This ``Trend Tracking'' is accomplished in seven policy areas: (1) Early childhood literacy, (2) future role of libraries, (3) sustainability/green initiatives, (4) staff development, (5) fund-raising, (6) programming and outreach, and (7) other. Staff consulted a variety of periodicals, Web sites, and library literature to assess four elements of their suggested trend: (1) application to Worthington Libraries, (2) impact on patrons, (3) impact on staff, and (4) relevant Web site or bibliographic links that served as the source or enrichment of the suggestion. This article provides library professionals with a rare opportunity to observe the internal thinking of a library workgroup other than their own.",

This paper also proposes possible solutions in response to the public's suggestions for improvements.\r\n\r\nDesign/methodology/approach\r\n\r\nA library--user survey was employed to appraise the functioning of the Beitou Branch Library by the general public. The questionnaire for this survey was divided into three parts: background information of patrons; patrons' use of the Beitou Branch Library; and patrons' opinions on the facilities of the Beitou Branch Library. The 511 valid returned patron questionnaires were numbered and processed by means of Microsoft Excel statistical analysis. Chi--square testing, ANOVA and Pearson T--test were then used to analyze the relevant data and statistics.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe findings from the Beitou Branch Library survey are as follows: its innovative design and unique architecture and furniture has created a trend for new design concepts in Taiwan; it increases the number of library visits; it increases the visibility of the library and changes the stereotype of the library in the public's mind; it embodies the principles of ecological education and has become a multi--faceted learning center; it has gained the support of local residents and professional experts; it has generated corporate sponsorship of green library buildings; and the average numbers and distribution of frequency indicate that, other than ``convenient parking'' and ``number of computers in the computer area'', patrons were generally satisfied with the library's facilities, with all other categories receiving an average rating of 3.5 or greater.",

Further reproduction of this article in violation of the copyright is prohibited. To contact the publisher: http://www.hwwilson.com/ What's a black box? It is some ingenious invention designed to revolutionize the way in which we work. In recent years, there has been a widespread if not universal acceptance and use in American libraries of network systems, commercial database searching systems, and turnkey systems from commercial vendors. As those and other library uses of automation have developed and matured, we have all come to accept them as solutions to our problems. Despite the real advantages of these systems, we need to regain some of the skepticism toward mechanical solutions to our problems expressed by Ralph R. Shaw almost thirty years ago. We should heed his admonishment to \"think kindly ... of those who take pity upon our benighted state to solve all our problems with machines they have not yet thought about.\"(FN1) The first black boxes A true library historian could undoubtedly locate a description of some mechanical wonder designed to provide quicker access to the papyrus at the Alexandrian library. As only an amateur library historian, I have not been able to locate such an early example. The earliest example of a black box that I have been able to locate dates only from 1588. Since 1959, the Council on Library Resources has used in its annual report a picture of a medieval scholar at his book-wheel. That picture shows the scholar seated at a large circular device that appears to hold as many as a dozen books as a time, any one of which he can bring to his line of vision by using a foot-activated pedal. This may be the earliest known example of the black box, but it is by no means the last. Our library landscape is littered with a profusion of such devices, most of which, if they are from the distant past, now appear to be somewhat quaint, if not ridiculous, although they may be fundamentally no different in their approach from the devices we now regard as our possible salvation. In the mid-nineteenth century, Charles Coffin Jewett proposed the use of stereotype plates as a means of producing and distributing catalog cards prepared at a central point. At about the same time, Henry Stevens was proposing the use of what he called photobibliography, which involved the direct use of photographs of the title pages of books as a part of catalog entries. While advanced for their time, and probably for that reason never implemented, both of those ideas at least had some merit, because they did seek to address the intellectual problems of sharing cataloging information and of developing catalog entries through the aid of mechanical devices. The late nineteenth century did see in both England and America the development of more mechanical solutions to problems that are illustrative of the black box syndrome. The Indicator Public libraries in England continued to operate with closed stacks during the nineteenth century, and the librarians of the time, while not yet prepared to allow readers direct access to their collections, were concerned about finding some way of indicating to patrons which books in the catalog were available for borrowing. The solution was the \"indicator,\" a device now found only in museums, the first of which was invented in 1863. Quickly thereafter, as many as ten or a dozen various kinds of indicators became available and were put into use. One model of the indicator, typical of the device in general, contained hundreds of small metal shelves placed in a heavy metal frame on a wooden base and covered by a sheet of glass. On each shelf was a miniature metal book representing a book in the collection. At opposite ends of the book were different colored tabs with the catalog number: one color indicated that the book was charged out, and the other color indicated that the book was available for use. After the reader had obtained the catalog number, he or she was thus able to determine the availability of the book without having to bother the library staff. This was the first public inquiry terminal. The indicator also served as the basis for the circulation system: when a book was charged out, the information about the borrower was recorded with the indicator's metal book. For all of its seeming advantages, the indicator had one major flaw. It should be obvious that for a collection of any size the amount of space required for the indicator soon became unmanageable. A collection of about four thousand volumes might require about six to eight feet of counter space for the indicator, but a collection of thirty thousand volumes might require as much as thirty-eight feet. It was the eventual adoption of open stacks that brought about the demise of the indicator. The real problem with the indicator, as is so often the case with black boxes, was not its advantages or disadvantages but the way in which it influenced the thinking of librarians. Writing in 1900, L. Stanley Jast, one of the most prominent British public librarians of that time, addressed \"The Mechanical Appliance Craze.\" Building on an earlier paper by Mr. McAlister, Jast suggested that: The amount of time and attention that is now bestowed upon this side of library work, to the inevitable detriment of its higher and nobler sides, is astonishing and lamentable. Now there is a subtle and fell fascination about these things, which if once allowed full play becomes a positive disease ... I have nothing to say against these things in themselves; it is a question of perspective with which I am concerned... Let us be librarians, not mechanics. That the danger of which I speak is neither imaginary or exaggerated is shown by the strenuous efforts which some of us are making to condition the whole economy of the lending library by the indicator. Those of us who run the indicator, and find it a meritorious piece of mechanism, which serves our purposes satisfactorily, may well object when it becomes a question of the indicator running us.(FN2) The card catalog American librarians were fortunate to have escaped the black box solution of the indicator, perhaps because their libraries moved earlier to open shelves or perhaps simply by accident. The one event, more than any other, which seems to have precipitated American librarian-ship into the black box syndrome was the shift from the printed to the card catalog in the late nineteenth century, when it became apparent that the continuing rapid growth of library collections required a more flexible means of providing information about a library's holdings to its users. We did not miraculously adopt the card catalog as we know it today; the literature of the period seems to be replete with mechanical solutions to this problem. The Library Journal for December 1893, for example, reports on the discussion held earlier that year at the Massachusetts Library Club on the question, \"Is There an Impending Revolution in Library Cataloging?\" According to that report, the discussion centered largely around mechanical issues, including a consideration of the problems encountered with the card catalog because so few users can consult it at one time. At the meeting, \"Mr. Lane said that by using trays which can be taken out, this trouble is partially obviated.\" In another note, appearing in The Library Journal in 1900, no less an authority than Melvil Dewey refers to such issues as the substitution of single trays for double drawers and the fact that \"trays, drawers, pockets, and various devices for convenient work have multiplied with wonderful rapidity.\" As librarians and libraries sought the black box solution that would create the ideal card catalog, some ingenious devices were forthcoming. On December 8, 1891, Charles N. Judson, who seems to have been an efficiency expert and a frustrated user, not a librarian, patented a card catalog drawer with the ever-popular double rod, designed \"to facilitate the examination of the several cards of which the card-catalogue is composed.\" His solution consisted of utilizing indented cards, with the indention and the text shifting from left to right on a card-by-card basis. As Judson carefully explained in his patent application: \"In consulting card-catalogues it is necessary to separate one card from another by inserting the finger or thumb between the cards, pulling the first card away from the pack in order to consult the next, and as the cards are frequently packed in the case quite tightly and stand close to each other it is often difficult to get them apart, causing great annoyance and irritation when haste is desired. The object of my invention is to so form the cards as to enable this to be done readily and at the same time they shall be so inscribed that they can be consulted in the easiest manner possible.\" The Library Journal for May 1892 contains a fascinating, if somewhat incomprehensible, description of \"The New Library Drawer\" designed by Frederic Badger, an assistant in the Harvard College Library. \"It is not supposed,\" the article boldly states, \"that old libraries can at once adopt it; its method effects too complete a revolution in the old ways; but it is confidently offered to new libraries and those now entering on library work. It claims to surpass all appliances heretofore used by libraries.\" From the description, for no copy of the actual drawer seems to have survived, it must have been very similar to the kardex units that most of us now use for our serials records. Undoubtedly the most famous and widely promoted black box of that era was Alexander J. Rudolph's fantastic \"continuous indexer,\" which was first announced to the world at the American Library Association's meeting in San Francisco in 1891. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Rudolph's invention was not the device itself but the extent to which it was promoted, with some success, as capable of solving all cataloging problems, even though it was little more than a different device for displaying catalog cards. In many respects similar to the scholar's book wheel, Rudolph's continuous indexer was simply a means for displaying a series of catalog cards on a revolving belt that could be cranked around in a cabinet until the appropriate cards appeared under a glass plate. Just as the indicator had become, for Jast, a symbol of the black box in England, so it seems this discussion about how to display catalog cards helped set American librarianship off on its quest for mechanical solutions to its problems. Badger's library drawer, Judson's card catalog, Rudolph's continuous indexer, and other black boxes of that time seem slightly ludicrous. We would like to think that common sense ultimately prevailed and that the solution selected, as represented in our present-day card catalog, was the correct one. But was it? Much of the discussion of such devices in the 1890s was ably summarized in an editorial in the December 1892 issue of The Library Journal. \"The question recurs, of course, whether the card catalog is, after all, the final form of the library catalog, and whether, having reached the millenium of the card catalog, we shall not have to begin over again on an improved system.\" Far from having reached a millenium, the card catalog is now in the process of being phased out after less than one hundred years of existence. Fascinated by technology Having resolved, for the time being, the problem of the card catalog, American librarians were able to spend the next half-century or so pursuing their fascination with machines along other avenues. Jast's warning never received much attention in this country, just as it had not in his own country. Fortunately, or unfortunately, no major black box project captured our imagination during that period, although, to some degree, circulation systems bid fair to do so with such splendid innovations as audio-charging. Rather, our imaginations were captured by a variety of lesser problems and less dramatic mechanical solutions to those problems. The space allotted to such solutions in the professional journals, the existence of the American Library Association's Committee on Equipment and Appliances, and some of the contemporary applications of equipment are all testimony to our quest for the perfect black box that would provide for one aspect of library service or another. Neither circulation systems nor other mechanical devices were a real challenge to American ingenuity. So, to some degree, the black box syndrome languished. But we had only to wait until the late 1930s for a new machine challenge, far greater than any seen before, to emerge in the shape of electronic data processing. All of that has led to the current fascination, vastly superior to the mid-nineteenth-century British enchantment with the indicator, that we now have with computers and other applications of contemporary technology to library problems. By the time we were well on our way to the initial stages of today's computer craze, Ralph Blasingame reflected on our love of gadgets, echoing Jast's earlier concerns. \"The common aim,\" he wrote in 1956, \"in introducing tools or machines into almost any process is to reduce the time or energy required to perform some operation or to produce a more uniformly satisfactory result. To stick to this rule in the application of what may be referred to as 'gadgets' is sometimes difficult; many of these devices have a kind of fascination for some librarians which occasionally obscures the true economics of their application.... Besides, another danger of the indiscriminate use of mechanical miscellanea is that work may actually be created for them.\"(FN3) Perhaps, in this last statement, Blasingame foresaw one of the major dangers of the computer that was to come. From the late 1930s through the early 1970s, the potential library applications of computer technology presented an unreal world of their own. Most often, as Ralph Shaw suggested in 1956, we failed to adequately distinguish between the form and the substance, or the word and the deed.(FN4) There were many valuable experiments, many useful developments, and even a few good operational systems. To read or recall the literature of that period, however, one would think that magnificent solutions to all of our problems had been developed. Shaw, who was one of the few contemporary critics of library automation, was frequently chastised for his skepticism, but to read his articles on the subject and compare their contents with the developments of the time only serves to reinforce his wisdom. In reality, a large percentage of the articles, books, and reports published at that time described systems, many of which were as bizarre as the card catalog solutions of the 1890s, that never existed, had serious flaws and were abandoned, or were as widely used as Judson's catalog drawer. \"Machines that they have not yet thought about\" As bizarre as those systems may seem and as interesting as it might be to examine them in some detail, they somehow seem perfectly sensible in contrast to the visions of the library future built during that same period around the black box \"machines that they have not yet thought about.\" It is far more interesting to examine some of those solutions, which parallel today's black boxes of tomorrow. The advent of computers and their potential application to library services brought with it a fascination with solving the problems of library management by users knowledgeable about machines and frustrated by librarians' failure to respond adequately to the challenge of those machines. Mr. Judson, with his \"great annoyance and irritation,\" was the forerunner of what was, for a period of time, a veritable flood of well-wishers. The first and most famous solution was proposed by the distinguished American scientist, Vannevar Bush, in 1945. Bush foresaw \u00e4 future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, 'memex' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.\"(FN5) Bush describes in some detail the physical appearance and inner workings of a memex, which would be a kind of desk, and its construction around microfilm. \"The Encyclopaedia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk.\" Fortunately, Bush did not discuss either the costs of developing a memex or the time when it might become available. Unfortunately, his approach served, in large measure, to suggest that this kind of black box solution to library problems was around the corner. In the early 1960s, under the sponsorship of the Council on Library Resources, J. C. R. Licklider of IBM investigated what he titled Libraries of the Future. Much of his work described the size of the body of human knowledge in mathematical terms, and analysis that is not easy to comprehend. He did predict, in more manageable terms, what we might expect based on certain assumptions about the growth of random-access memory capabilities. \"It would be possible,\" Licklider stated, \"to put all of the solid literature of a subfield of science or technology into a single computer memory in 1985.... All this refers to fast, random-access digital memory. How fast? ... only an optimist would hope for access shorter than 0.1 microsecond.\"(FN6) Project Intrex, conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965 (but not, I hasten to add, within the library there), was yet another attempt to describe the library of the future, in this case in an effort to describe what the information transfer process at MIT might be like by 1975. By that time, according to calculations, a computer-based system would contain a restricted field of \u00e4bout 5,000 books at 300 pages per book and 100 journals, the entire contents of each of which may since its inception approximate 2,500 pages of text.\"(FN7) By 1971, John G. Kemeny, president of Dartmouth College, was proclaiming his vision of the library of the future. Reverting back to Bush's concept of microfilm, Kemeny suggested that with ultra-microfiche \"1,000 miniaturized volumes can be stored in one ordinary card file a foot long,\" and \u00e4 million such volumes could be kept in 1,000 card drawers, with the drawers numbered and the cards numbered within the drawers.\" Such a simple solution, not even as ingenious as Rudolph's continuous indexer or the indicator, would provide faster access than the conventional library \"but, obviously, an automated system can do much better.\"(FN8) These are a few examples, selected not entirely at random, of black box solutions. They foreshadow the work of those who now tout videodisc technology or who forecast a paperless information society. One of the most recent of these solutions promotes the idea that videodisc/microcomputer technology could store the entire National Union Catalog on one disc and provide an average access time of 2.5 seconds. All this at a cost, including hardware, of less than $5,000--that is, after the initial production costs for the transfer of the information to the videodisc. What went wrong? Why have the solutions of Bush, Licklider, Project Intrex, and Kemeny failed to materialize? Why do their projections already seem as quaint, in their own fashion, as the card catalog solutions of Badger, Judson, and Rudolph? Can we really expect a videodisc of die National Union Catalog to appear in the near future, heralded by a brochure advertising all of its wonders, including the hardware, for less than $5,000? Will the paperless information society be here by the year 2000? The answers seem obvious. For those visions of the future, suggested such a short time ago, many things have gone wrong. Technology has neither developed along the lines the visionaries suggested, nor as quickly as they thought it would. It never does. Microforms have real advantages for many library applications and serve us well, but that medium has not yet begun to, and it is never likely to, serve as a substantial substitute for the printed word. Above all, the demand for these solutions has not been there. The planners failed to take into account all of the costs of their systems, especially in terms of how all of that information was to be transformed miraculously into some new storage medium. Those costs can be staggering and are beyond the present realm of reality for libraries, given their role in society. Project Intrex, for example, in looking at the information transfer system at MIT in 1975, proposed that it would take an annual operating budget of $15 million to provide the kinds of services it envisaged; in 1980-1981, the MIT libraries, which manage traditional library systems involving some use of automation, had a total operating budget of just over $5 million. The best analysis of this aspect of the problem has come from Nicholas Alter of University Microfilms International. Looking at only a comparatively small body of literature, akin in many ways to what Licklider and Project Intrex examined, Alter describes some of the problems. He suggests that \"to put full-text computer storage costs in perspective, consider the cost of mounting an online full-text distribution service for doctoral dissertations ... The texts of the thirty thousand new dissertations that UMI receives annually from American universities would take roughly two and a half million hours to key and proof for computer entry, at a labor cost of several million dollars--clearly not a practical option.\" According to Alter, the additional costs of storage and access \"quickly escalate into a multimillion dollar annual investment.\"(FN10) It is all too easy to be misled by our desire for these black boxes to think that they will somehow materialize without cost. The videodisc of The National Union Catalog will probably fall by the wayside because of the minor matter of the initial production costs for the transfer of the information to the videodisc. That is always the way. We tend to look at the glamour of such solutions and not at the practical reality of how those solutions are to be accomplished. If there is a moral to this examination of the black box syndrome through the library ages, it is a twofold one. First, it is abundantly clear, the black box solution to our problems will always be with us. As the technological base of society increases, so can we expect the scope and vision of those solutions to increase. Second, and this is the true moral, we need to continue to be skeptical of the claims and promises of technology. We have come a long way since Alexandria, since the scholar's wheel, since the indicator, and since the card catalog. We have even come a long way since the first applications of computer technology to library operations and the first visions of the library of the future. Automation and technology have done much to improve library operations in the 1980s; they will do much to further improve library operations in the next two decades. But we should not expect miracles. I, for one, suspect that libraries will not be all that much different by the year 2000 from the way they are now.

        "abstract": "This article provides recommendations that can be used by public library services and associated organisations when considering building or refurbishing library buildings. Recommendations range from simple and easy-to-implement practices and procedures, to large-scale building development. It also provides a framework for libraries to follow when designing a new building, refurbishing existing buildings and raising community awareness of the benefits of designing and running sustainable libraries. The article looks at sustainability and its importance within a library, refurbishment of library buildings, greener work practices and public education initiatives. Three key areas of sustainability are highlighted: building/refurbishing, sustainable practices and education. The recommendations and concepts noted in the article are demonstrated through a case study of the Melton Library and Learning Hub in Victoria. In the relative absence of relevant Victorian publications, Tomorrow's Green Public Library also serves as a resource guide to direct public libraries to further information and publications available.

        "abstract": "S. R. Ranganathan, considered by librarians all over the world to be the father of modern library science, proposed five laws of library science in the early 1930s. Most librarians worldwide accept them as the foundations of the philosophy of their work and service in the library. These laws are: Books are for use, Every reader his or her book, Every book its reader, Save the time of the reader, and The library is a growing organism. The Five Laws of Library Science are some of the most influential concepts in the field. Since they were published in 1931, these five laws \"have remained a centerpiece of professional values...\" (Rubin 2004). These basic theories of Library Science continue to directly impact the development of this discipline and the service of all libraries. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The book has been reprinted over twenty-five times to meet the demand from libraries, students of library and information science and information professionals. In 2006 when DLIST (University of Arizona) placed a test version of the contents page and first chapter of the first edition of the book on the Internet, there were some 640 downloads in twenty-four hours. The \"five laws\" are equally valid in the present digital / information age as they have been in the conventional library environment. - Publisher.",

The weblogs were studied using content analysis techniques. Library weblogs were found in just three countries, with the majority being in the USA. Public and academic libraries were more likely to have a weblog than other types of libraries. The most common aim or purpose was to provide news, information and links to Internet resources for library users. Few provided interactive facilities, and when provided, there was little evidence that the facilities were used to any extent. Only one-fifth of the weblogs had been updated within the past day and only half within the previous week. Less than half provided an RSS feed. Given the small number of library weblogs in the study, the question of \"why so few?\" is discussed. Finally, the article addresses the implications of the findings for library managers.",

The protocol allows LC to make digitized historical collections available for integration into other services. The protocol was straightforward to implement and the harvesting traffic has no perceptible effect on the primary users of the American Memory project. Now that services can integrate records for cultural heritage resources from many sources, it is time to build on that experience to develop better services. How should the scarce resources available to produce metadata be deployed to most advantage to support discovery in different contexts? How might metadata harvesting be exploited to support new interfaces and enhanced navigation among related resources in digital libraries?

This undertaking has numerous highlights that are commonly not accessible in typical integrated library system, facilities like separate user interfaces for different users having different priorities. It also has a facility of admin login. Through this, the admin can monitor the whole system. In this system, users can see the list of books they have taken and its issue date, return date and also they can reserve the books online. The fine count is robotized with exactness. The application is intended to assist clients in maintaining and organizing the library. It is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users. It incorporates a recognizable, well thoroughly considered, and appealing UI joined with solid searching, insertion and reporting capacities. Generally, this task of our own is being created to help students as well as the staff to keep up the library in the most ideal manner conceivable and decrease human endeavors.

A large customer base for electronic medical information resources is both comfortable with and eager to migrate to the electronic format completely, and vendors are designing radical pricing models that make print journal cancellations economically advantageous. In this (almost) post-print environment, the new FSU Medical Library is being created and will continue to evolve. By analyzing print journal subscription lists of eighteen academic medical libraries with similar missions to the community-based FSU College of Medicine and by entering these and selected quality indicators into a Microsoft Access database, a core list was created. This list serves as a selection guide, as a point for discussion with faculty and curriculum leaders when creating budgets, and for financial negotiations in a broader university environment. After journal titles specific to allied health sciences, veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, library science, and nursing were eliminated from the list, 4,225 unique journal titles emerged. Based on a ten-point scale including SERHOLD holdings and DOCLINE borrowing activity, a list of 449 core titles is identified. The core list has been saved in spreadsheet format for easy sorting by a number of parameters.",

Shared subscription or consortia-based subscription to electronic resources through the consortia of libraries, on one hand, it permits successful deployment and easy access to electronic resources at a highly negotiated rates of subscription and on the other hand, it meets with the increasing pressures of diminishing budget, increased user's demand and rising cost of journals. Having understood the impact of consortia government of India supported many academic and research institutions to establish consortia in various areas of research and education institutions.

        "abstract": "This study was undertaken in twenty-two small private liberal arts colleges to determine the degree of consensus by the library directors, the library staff, the faculty, and the administrators on twenty-four statements dealing with the library director's role. Major findings are as follows: The respondents were more in favor of roles pertaining to library-related activities\u2013especially those of planning for the library, representing the library's interests, monitoring the collection, being responsible for library materials, and consulting with the library staff and delegating decision making\u2013than they were of roles pertaining to academic activities or faculty prerogatives\u2013especially those of serving on faculty committees, sharing in curriculum decisions, voting at faculty meetings, and having faculty rank, tenure, and sabbaticals. Among those roles with which the respondents were least in favor were those of doing research and publishing, allocating book funds, and fund-raising for the institution. Analyses of responses also identified relationships which exist between various characteristics of the respondents and the attitudes on the role statements. Major conclusions are that variations in the perceptions of the role are related more to one's status within the organizational structure of the institution than to sex, age, faculty rank or division, highest degree, tenure, or opinions on the rank of the director, the identity of the director, or the identity of the library staff. Major implications are that there is also a role of the faculty in some of the decision making for the library, that collaborative efforts between the director and the faculty are expected in some areas, and that there is a need for developing programs to address the areas of greatest difference in perceptions of the role.",

The QMS procedures and products include managing \r\ninterrelated processes as an entire system; measuring customer satisfaction through a survey form \r\nand acting on the results; the creation of a Quality Manual, a Procedures Map, and a Services \r\nChart. The analysis of the development of these procedures and results will permit the evaluation of \r\nthis model for other National libraries.",

Several types of optimizations are supported,\r\nincluding differentiable, separable, constrained, and categorical objective\r\nfunctions. The library provides many pre-built optimizers (including numerous\r\nvariants of SGD and Quasi-Newton optimizers) as well as a flexible framework\r\nfor implementing new optimizers and objective functions. Implementation of a\r\nnew optimizer requires only one method and a new objective function requires\r\ntypically one or two C++ functions. This can aid in the quick implementation\r\nand prototyping of new machine learning algorithms. Due to the use of C++\r\ntemplate metaprogramming, ensmallen is able to support compiler optimizations\r\nthat provide fast runtimes. Empirical comparisons show that ensmallen is able\r\nto outperform other optimization frameworks (like Julia and SciPy), sometimes\r\nby large margins. The library is distributed under the BSD license and is ready\r\nfor use in production environments.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe Doody's Core Titles in the Health Sciences as a new selection guide and a virtual community based on an effective use of online systems and to describe its potential impact on library collection development. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/RESOURCES: The setting is the availability of health sciences selection guides. Participants include Doody Enterprise staff, Doody's Library Board of Advisors, content specialists, and library selectors. Resources include the online system used to create Doody's Core Titles along with references to complementary databases. BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Doody's Core Titles is described and discussed in relation to the literature of selection guides, especially in comparison to the Brandon/Hill selected lists that were published from 1965 to 2003. Doody's Core Titles seeks to fill the vacuum created when the Brandon/Hill lists ceased publication. Doody's Core Titles is a unique selection guide based on its method of creating an online community of experts to identify and score a core list of titles in 119 health sciences specialties and disciplines. RESULTS/OUTCOME: The result is a new selection guide, now available annually, that will aid health sciences librarians in identifying core titles for local collections. EVALUATION METHOD: Doody's Core Titles organizes the evaluation of core titles that are identified and recommended by content specialists associated with Doody's Book Review Service and library selectors. A scoring mechanism is used to create the selection of core titles, similar to the star rating system employed in other Doody Enterprise products and services.",

Further reproduction of this article in violation of the copyright is prohibited. To contact the publisher: http://www.ala.org/ Walt Crawford In preparing to speak at the 30th anniversary of the University of Tennessee's School of Information Science last fall, I looked at some elements of library life in 1972 and 1973. How many people remember what library services and technology were like three decades ago? I worked at the University of California at Berkeley's Doe Library in 1973, having designed and implemented the punch-card circulation system that was Doe's first library automation. We had a visit from the FBI very early in the 1970s and learned to destroy circulation records as soon as items were returned. How's your 2003 privacy audit going? Can you assure readers that their circulation histories are private? You haven't done a privacy audit? You should. YOUR LIBRARY IN 1972-73 You almost certainly had a card catalog. MARC II existed, but shared online cataloging was in its infancy--OCLC went online in 1971, but primarily served a few dozen Ohio institutions by 1973. BALLOTS, the underlying software for RLG's RLIN, went online in November 1972--but RLG didn't exist until 1975. WLN began offering services in late 1972, but didn't go online until 1975 or later. You might have had a circulation system using a \"minicomputer\" that you'd consider huge by today's standards, but with a fraction of the power of today's cheapest PCs. It's possible that you searched remote databases on SDC or BRS with a state-of-the-art 300-bps modem, or, in a university library, searched locally mounted databases through batch processing. Library automation began considerably earlier. The Information Science and Automation Division, the earlier name of ALA's Library and Information Technology Association, began in 1966. Microprocessors already existed (Intel's 8088 came out in late 1972, the 8080 in 1973), but personal computers didn't appear until 1975; the first widely used models (Commodore PET, Apple II, Radio Shack TRS-80) showed up in 1977. The first IBM PC was still eight years away--and that PC didn't have any hard disk. The books on your shelves didn't have ISBNs, although a few of them might have had SBNs, the predecessor standard adopted in 1973. If you circulated movies at all, they were films, probably 16mm reels. You might have had some U-Matic videocassettes (introduced in 1971), but Betamax and VHS came along in 1975 and 1976. 1973 was a banner year for hard disks, but they were too big, slow, and expensive for most library use. The first modern hard disk, IBM's 3340 \"Winchester,\" appeared that year--a 14-inch, 80-pound beast costing thousands of dollars and holding 35 to 70 megabytes. It was attached to room-filling mainframe computers. The first PC hard disk appeared seven years later, cost about $1,000 once you added case and power supply, and only held five or 10 megabytes--but it was a modest 5.25 inches in diameter. Today's PC disk measures 3.5 inches in diameter and holds 200 gigabytes--40,000 times as much as the original PC disk. It costs about $300. You might have used fax--slow, expensive, and ugly, but the technology was established more than a century ago. There were fax (frequently called \"telefax\" or \"telefacsimile\" back then) experiments within library groups as early as the late 1960s, but they were rarely very successful. The pricing problem with scientific, technical, and medical journals was alive and well 30 years ago. Berkeley, for example, carried out a budget-related 10% serials cut in the early 1970s. THE REVOLUTIONARY EVOLUTION Back then we were talking about library networks, but few of us could envision the Internet. We were learning about MARC II, a painful process that took another decade. Libraries learned earlier than most that the computer wasn't magic. No revolution occurred between 1973 and 2003--but for most libraries and librarians, the overall changes could be considered revolutionary. Even then, the crisis-mongers and hypesters were active. If libraries didn't transform themselves using computer-based tools and replacements for the book--microfilm being the replacement of choice--they would disappear. But somehow, despite using boring old books and failing to make every librarian a programmer (another necessary transformation touted a few years later), libraries have survived. The tools have improved, and the core missions remain. ADDED MATERIAL WALT CRAWFORD is a senior analyst at the Research Libraries Group in Mountain View, California.

Before an academic library can adequately address the needs, preferences, and expectations of its remote patrons, however, it needs to understand the peculiarities and challenges of serving patrons at a distance. Penn State University&#039;s World Campus (a virtual campus) is one of the leading distance education institutions in the USA, and its libraries are among those actively engaged in ascertaining the needs of remote library users and developing services and resources to meet these needs. A portrait of library resources and services available to World Campus students is presented, and results of a survey conducted to assess Penn State World Campus students&#039; perceptions, expectations and use of Web-based library resources are reported. A key finding is that students are pleased with the quality and availability of library services, but not fully partaking of the vast array of services and collections.",

We\n\tsought to identify peptides as lead structures interacting with G\n\tproteins utilizing a commercially available phage-display library.\n\tThe heptapeptide library was screened for binding to human G alpha(i1)\n\twhich was modified with a hexahistidine tag and immobilized on a\n\tNi(2+)-coated surface. After several rounds of phage selection a\n\tnumber of phage clones with consensus sequences were found. Peptides\n\twith such sequences were chemically synthesized and their effect\n\ton 35SGTP gamma S binding to G alpha(i1) and other G protein alpha\n\tsubunits was determined. Through this process two peptide 'families'\n\twith the capability to activate G proteins were identified. The peptides\n\tshowed no structural similarity to known peptide or nonpeptide G\n\tprotein activators with a cationic amphiphilic structure like mastoparan\n\tor alkylamines. The functional relevance of the peptide-G protein\n\tinteraction was shown by an increased sensitivity for guanine nucleotides\n\tof high-affinity agonist binding to A(1) adenosine receptors. The\n\tpeptide G protein activators may, therefore, serve as novel tools\n\tfor further investigation of receptor-independent activation of G\n\tproteins.",

How do you find out what\u2019s making your people dread coming into work and find solutions that engage and empower them and benefit your library? This article describes the process and findings from a project, funded by a grant from Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI) for the 2015-2016 academic year, to train a small cohort of academic librarians in a practical, hands-on management system called Recording/Interpreting/Solving Workflow Solutions. RISWS involves a weekly reporting process that formalizes employees sharing information on both issues affecting their work and achievements they might not otherwise report to their managers.",

        "abstract": "Established in 1973, The Indonesian Library Association has contributed significantly for the development of professional librarian in Indonesia. It has branches in every province and serving million  people every year. With robust network and solid organization, the association has regular annual meeting attended by almost thousands of its loyal members making it one of the largest professional organization in Indonesia. It is the only one formal library association in Indonesia dealing with librarians. Provoked by monetary crisis in Indonesia which melted down the fragile economic foundation and forced the longest    served president, the late Soeharto to quit, Indonesia suddenly become a ?new state? adopting democratic styled government, more   open   society And real free market. These unexpected changes have had tremendous impacts on   many walks of life including professional institutions. Euphoria that followed reform movement   has dispersed power concentration by the establishment of new political parties. Fortyeight new political parties joined eligibly the first democratic general election in 1999. Reform spirits also intruded to The Indonesian Library Association (ILA)locally known as Ikatan  Pustakawan Indonesia (IPI). It faced highly demanding members who wanted some substantial changes in the organization structure and   custodians and the implementation  of power sharing   favoring the association branches and chapters in the   provinces and districts. Up to the present the top position of the association traditionally goes to the head of National Library.  With his or her  beauracratic style in leadership, some consider not suitable anymore for the new paradigm of modern and democratic organization.To compound the problems, some librarians have established four forums and  one    scholars   association    namely Public Library  Forum,  University   Library  Forum (FPPTI), School Library Forum (APISI/FPS), Special Library Forum (FPK) and  The  Association of Indonesian Library and Information Scholars (ISIIPI). They are autonomous semi formal entity. Judging this  unfavorable condition, the board and management of ILA has taken some bold measurements   by inviting some   new   faces, young librarians with strong commitment and  high competency to participate actively and  directly in  decision making process in the association board meeting and put them in strategic position in the organizational structure.    Moreover, the association has no objection in the   implementation of power sharing making its branches and   chapters more autonomous and creative as well. It also    simplified its organizational structure to accommodate    some changes in modern setting and globalization era. By reinventing its management style and streaming line the organization,the Association has  managed to satisfy the majority of its   members and attracting more new members especially the young  professional librarians.",

The machine has generated tremendous excitement on campus already, and initial experience and patron response both suggest that the EBM will turn out to be useful in ways not anticipated.",

        "abstract": "In 1998 Brighton\u2019s city council decided to build a new library. The library was designed using a public-private partnership model and the public was involved in the planning. It became in many ways a sustainable building, and since its inauguration in 2005 the library has received more than a dozen awards for it. The library was also well accepted by the citizens. The increase in usage, as well as technical innovations led to some adjustments to the construction. The library continuously evaluates its consumption in order to improve. Seven years later a critical look at the energy consumption and feedback from the building occupants show how well the edifice actually performs according to calculations.\r\n1998 entschloss sich die Stadt Brighton zum Bau einer neuen Bibliothek. Die Realisierung erfolgte nach dem Public Private PartnershipModell, und die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wurde an der Planung beteiligt. Es entstand ein in vielerlei Hinsicht nachhaltiges Geb\u00e4ude, wof\u00fcr die Bibliothek bereits mehr als ein Dutzend Preise erhielt. Die Bibliothek wurde von der Bev\u00f6lkerung gut angenommen. Der hohe Zuwachs an Nutzern sowie technische Neuerungen machten einige Anpassungen am Bau n\u00f6tig. Die Bibliothek evaluiert kontinuierlich ihre Verbrauchswerte, um diese stetig zu verbessern. Sieben Jahre nach dem Bezug wirft dieser Beitrag einen kritischen Blick auf den Energieverbrauch. Ein Feedback der Geb\u00e4udenutzer zeigt, inwieweit das Geb\u00e4ude heute die bei der planerischen Kalkulation bezifferten Ziele erreicht.",

Every Library maintains a register to maintain the data about members who entered library. Some colleges still use the traditional approaches of maintaining register, which is difficult to maintain, to check and to analyze data. So, we propose a new system in which students are passed through camera at entry point of the library where the students facial patterns are recognized and create the entry record into the database on clicking the button.

The Initiative aims to re-envision and, in the long run, implement a new bibliographic environment for libraries that makes \"the network\" central and makes interconnectedness commonplace. Prompted in no small part by the desire to embrace new cataloging norms, it is essential that the library community redevelop its bibliographic data models as part of this Initiative. Toward that objective, this document presents a high-level model for the library community for evaluation and discussion, but it is also important to consider this document within a much broader context, and one that looks well beyond the library community.\"",

Hence, a new revolution in the form of green libraries is emerging that is not only thought provoking but also needs to follow for long time sustainability in the library world. The need for green technology services to the users are also growing and becoming very essential day by day. Libraries are in good position in promoting environmental awareness. Libraries can lead to develop ecological sustainability practice, reusing of materials, reducing waste and toxic products and developing alternative technologies. Green technology focuses on natural environment in rapidly growing world population. This technology paid great attention in organisations and libraries are also not exception from it. Library architecture must also go in par with the concept of green building, which has no adverse effect on its natural surroundings. Libraries are in excellent position to be both an ecological operator and promoter of environmental awareness. It is an attempt to discuss this new emerging thought along with the librarians\u2019 role in making the libraries more greener for good and healthy environment. This article focuses on the concept of green library and features of it. This article explains issues and challenges of green library. This article demonstrates the various sustainable strategies for the libraries and highlights the strategies for overcoming the impact of paper use, ink use and electricity. It also provides different approach for the librarians to achieve green practices/Services.",

It describes the efforts at the digital conversion of local information and resources held in some university libraries and national institutions in Nigeria. Theses and dissertations are the most commonly digitised, while others are newspapers, past question papers, manuscripts and special collections. The article also explores issues for the successful conversion of library materials to digital format and skills development opportunities and challenges in Africa. It submits that the willingness to share experiences gathered on digitisation programmes would broaden the knowledge base and contribute to the development of digitised African local content.

In the\r\nresearch community, implementing and benchmarking various advanced tasks are\r\nstill painful and time-consuming with existing libraries. To facilitate graph\r\ndeep learning research, we introduce DIG: Dive into Graphs, a research-oriented\r\nlibrary that integrates unified and extensible implementations of common graph\r\ndeep learning algorithms for several advanced tasks. Currently, we consider\r\ngraph generation, self-supervised learning on graphs, explainability of graph\r\nneural networks, and deep learning on 3D graphs. For each direction, we provide\r\nunified implementations of data interfaces, common algorithms, and evaluation\r\nmetrics. Altogether, DIG is an extensible, open-source, and turnkey library for\r\nresearchers to develop new methods and effortlessly compare with common\r\nbaselines using widely used datasets and evaluation metrics.

The concept of green library movement among the Indian library community is still in the grassroots level whereas in International scenario it has already gained popularity. Therefore the main motto of this paper is to raise awareness about the green library movement and also to promote the idea among the library professionals to take a clear stand and create a visible green image for the library as an important part of their academic and social responsibility. The next as well as present generation of LIS profession should be encouraged to spread the ``Green library movement'' in their libraries.",

He was struck by how much of the commentary in the material could be applied to the current state of library automation and by how short-lived so much of the technology now seems.; TXT: AUTHOR: Andrew K. Pace TITLE: In the Beginning... SOURCE: American Libraries 38 no6 52-3 Je/Jl 2007 COPYRIGHT: The magazine publisher is the copyright holder of this article and it is reproduced with permission. Further reproduction of this article in violation of the copyright is prohibited. To contact the publisher: http://www.ala.org/ Harry S. Truman said, \"The only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.\" With blogs, instant messaging, and about five too many 24-hour news channels, the gap between news and history seems to be getting smaller and smaller (to say nothing of the quality of 'the news'). So I rejoiced at the notion that this month's theme was a centennial celebration of the history of American Libraries. Finally, I could write about old technology news without fear of instant staleness. I went into the stacks of D. H. Hill Library at North Carolina State University to get some of those things the kids are calling \"books on paper.\" The shelves are alive with the history of library automation. And while I got called out by a reader a few months ago for marking 1936 as the dawn of library automation ('what about the automobile?'), I still won't try to backdate my current definition of library automation to precede punch cards in order to include beauties like the first bookmobile and the electric eraser. I love those old volumes of the Journal of Library Automation (JLA), precursor to Information Technology and Libraries (ITAL), the scholarly publication of ALA's Library and Information Technology Association. The forefathers of library automation (sorry, they seem to have been all men in that first issue) were there for the 1968 inaugural issue--Ned Morris, Richard Johnson, Robert Wedge worth, Richard Chapin, Dale Pretzer, and, one of my absolute favorites, Richard De Gennaro. They wrote about Texas A&I's acquisitions system, Stanford's book catalog, Brown's fund-accounting system, machine-readable shelf lists, and the nascent history of library automation. Frederick G. Kilgour served as editor. Fast forward For the September 2006 issue of ITAL, I had the good fortune to coauthor a 4 0th-anniversary article with my colleagues Kristin Antelman and Emily Lynema. \"Toward a Twenty-First Century Library Catalog\" is about NCSU's new book catalog, a story that begins with the early history like that discussed by De Gennaro 40 years prior. My point is not to suggest that my colleagues and I are now on some sort of path to greatness because we got an article published in ITAL. It is that we are on the same path that was first trod over half a century ago. As I browsed the pages of JLAI ITAL and half a dozen books from a quarter-century ago, I was struck by how easily I could take a lot of the quotes out of context and apply them to the state of library automation in 2007. I was equally struck by how fleeting so much of the technology now seems. I could not help but wonder about the fate of Flickr, Second Life, about a dozen or so current members of the library-niche market, and yes, even Google. What will we say of them in another quarter-century? Vendors were there, too In 1968, Input Services was converting library catalog cards to magnetic tape with an optical page scanner. Herner and Company promised consulting services for Information Systems and Programs that were not \"wedded to any single system or line of hardware.\" By 1977, the library knowledge base was growing. F. W. Faxon (whose buyout by RoweCom became infamous when the latter went bust, leaving many subscription orders unfulfilled) (AL, Feb. 2003, p. 13) was offering customers a journal price-history database called SCOPE. In 1977, only a handful of years after 1968's Input Services promised conversion of library cards to magnetic tape \"in your library's format,\" Library Interface Systems was converting those records to LC MARC II, greatly reducing staff time. That same year, CLSI introduced the LIBS 100 Browsing Terminal with \u00e4 touch-sensitive screen that allows library patrons to retrieve bibliographic information from the online catalog with a touch of the finger.\" Thirty years ago, automating the library was a different kind of uphill battle. \"Some persons have suggested that automation, while it may serve the needs of the industrial worker, will not serve the needs of the librarian since it tends to make him a servant to the machine,\" suggested prolific information-science author Frank S. Patrinostro in the 1973 Proceedings of the LARC Institute on Automation of Libraries in School Systems (Library Automation Research and Consulting, an association extant from 1969 to 1974). The Library of Congress published the MARC Pilot Project in 1968, the same year as that first issue of JLA. That legacy is still with us, a part of our history not so easily shaken off. In 2057 or 2107, what will be this generation's milestone equivalent of the MARC record? Will any of the vendors we know today still be around when so few from the late 1960s and early 1970s survive today? ADDED MATERIAL ANDREW K.

Abstract Objective \u2013 To discuss the theoretical design of a measure of library quality and value that could be used across functional areas of a library in order to justify and maximize the allocation of resources. Design \u2013 This theoretical article provides background on how to conceptualize and develop a quantitative measure of library goodness. Setting \u2013 The process delineated is applicable to any library, whether public, academic, or special. Subjects \u2013 The intended audience is library management, both at the director and the department head levels. Methods \u2013 The author provided examples and questions in the development of appropriate variables. Main Results \u2013 The author presented a discussion of potential variables. These variables include library capability and utilization. Conclusion \u2013 The article concluded with a discussion of the major desiderata for an effective measure of library goodness: appropriateness, informativeness, validity, reproducibility, comparability, and practicality.\\textless/p\\textgreater",

One option is a mandatory student fee dedicated to the library. This article presents the results of a survey of 152 deans and directors of public R1 and R2 research universities that were asked whether their libraries benefit from mandatory student fees. While a library-specific fee is unusual, nearly half of responding libraries are eligible to receive some portion of another mandatory student fee. Study results can serve as evidence for libraries preparing to make a case for the significant, positive impact possible through even a modest library fee.",

Design/methodology/approach ? The approach is a description of the service its business model, management structure and technical base with an emphasis on how this does or does not work for the user. Findings ? Portals are not great user experiences. This is further complicated in the case of The European Library by the language barrier for search and retrieval across national boundaries. However, the existence of The European Library is at least of accessing material that would otherwise remain only accessible within the library itself. It is also a big step towards the creation of a European Digital Library. Originality/value ? The paper discusses more of the effects of such a portal on the user than has elsewhere been published. The value is in its description of collaborative working, its example of a management and organisational structure, its working business model and the technical solution that sits behind it. As an example of creating cross country and cultural access to digitised information it has been successful to date.",

Academic libraries shift their service model from information-centered to knowledge-centered services in order to be adapted to the challenged environment. This article proposes an embedded library research support service model based on knowledge management and explains how elements and process of the framework function through a case study in which knowledge management services were delivered by a subject librarian of Xiamen University. The new service model, called embedded service model, is based on a theoretical assumption that library services could be defined as the process of building a community of practice, in which group members, including librarians and researchers, are tied by common interests in a domain. In this model, librarians engage in knowledge sharing within the community and play special roles in knowledge acquisition, organization, sharing, creation and application. This article concludes that knowledge management provides an effective and concrete foundation for librarian to establish relationships among users, technologies and resources in the context of research community.",
